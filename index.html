        <h2>Biology is buns</h2>

        <p class="special">What are enzymes? Enzymes are proteins that act as biological catalysts, speeding up metabolism and allowing our bodies to function the way they are supposed to. Without enzymes, many reactions in the human body, such as digestion and cellular respiration, would be far too slow to sustain life. That is why humans and all living things have naturally produced enzymes. An enzyme works using the “lock and key mechanism.” In this mechanism, the enzyme is the lock, and the substance it acts on is like a key. The key, also known as the substrate, is the molecule that fits the enzyme and that the enzyme changes during a reaction, and each enzyme can only act on a particular kind of substrate. The part where the substrate fits is the active site, which looks like a dent in the enzyme. It has a shape complementary to that of a specific substrate, and when the substrate and enzyme collide, they form an enzyme-substrate complex. The enzyme-substrate complex will then transform into one or more products and then be released, making the enzyme ready for another substrate molecule. This process is necessary for processes like digestion and DNA replication.</p>
